# Surge
*Swift + Accelerate*

[Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Accelerate/Reference/AccelerateFWRef/_index.html) is a framework that provides high-performance functions for matrix math, digital signal processing, and image manipulation. It harnesses [SIMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instructions available in modern CPUs to significantly improve performance of certain calculations.

Because of its relative obscurity and inconvenient APIs, Accelerate is not commonly used by developers... which is a shame, since many applications could benefit from these performance optimizations.

**Surge aims to bring Accelerate to the mainstream, making it as easy (and nearly as fast, in most cases) to perform computation over a set of numbers as for a single member.**

Though, keep in mind: _Accelerate is not a silver bullet_. Under certain conditions, such as performing simple calculations over a small data set, Accelerate can be out-performed by conventional algorithms. Always benchmark to determine the performance characteristics of each potential approach.

> Curious about the name _Surge_? Back in the mid 90's, Apple, IBM, and Motorola teamed up to create [AltiVec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltiVec) (a.k.a the Velocity Engine), which provided a SIMD instruction set for the PowerPC architecture. When Apple made the switch to Intel CPUs, AltiVec was ported to the x86 architecture and rechristened [Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Accelerate/Reference/AccelerateFWRef/_index.html). The derivative of Accelerate (and second derivative of Velocity) is known as either [jerk, jolt, surge, or lurch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_%28physics%29), hence the name of this library.

## Performance

Initial benchmarks on iOS devices and the iOS simulator indicate significant performance improvements over a conventional Swift implementation.

```swift
import Surge

let numbers: [Double] = ... // 1000000 Elements
var sum: Double = 0.0

// Naïve Swift Implementation
sum = reduce(numbers, 0.0, +) // Time: 5.700 sec (2% STDEV)

// Surge Implementation
sum = Surge.sum(numbers) // Time: 0.001 sec (17% STDEV)
```

|    _n_     |   Swift   |   Surge   |   Δ   |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 100        | 0.001 sec | 0.000 sec |   ?   |
| 10000      | 0.058 sec | 0.000 sec |   ?   |
| 1000000    | 5.700 sec | 0.001 sec | 5700x |
| 100000000  |    ?      | 0.087 sec |   ?   |

> It was difficult to make a reasonable performance comparison between the two implementations, as the Accelerate-backed function did not register >= 1 msec runtime  until `n = 1000000`. At `n = 100000000`, the naïve implementation effectively timed out after several minutes.

> Surge's performance characteristics have not yet been thoroughly evaluated, though initial benchmarks show incredible promise. Further investigation is definitely warranted.

## Installation

_The infrastructure and best practices for distributing Swift libraries are currently in flux during this beta period of Swift & Xcode. In the meantime, you can add Surge as a git submodule, drag the `Surge.xcodeproj` file into your Xcode project, and add `Surge.framework` as a dependency for your target._
